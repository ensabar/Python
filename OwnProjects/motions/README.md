* In this project i would like to create a dashboard and a configuarble visualization of differents motions. In order to structure properly this project. The main steps:

1. Investigate about different types of motion and describe its equations.
   1. [Simple harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion)
   2. [Linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motion)
   3. [Reciprocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocating_motion)
   4. [Brownian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion)
   5. [Circular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion)
   6. [Rotatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation)
   7. [Curvilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_motion)
   8. [Rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling)
   9. [Oscillatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation)
   10. [Vibratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration)
   11. Combination
   12. [Projectile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion)
2. Investigate about types of visualization.
   1. [Article with inforamtion about animated plots](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/live-plotting-with-matplotlib.html)
   2. [Artcile for a 3D animated plot](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-animate-plots-in-python-2512327c8263)
3. Create a dashboard
4. Enable configuration parameters by screen buttons or inputs
