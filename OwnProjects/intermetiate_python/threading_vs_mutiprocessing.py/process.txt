Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and course
+ Separate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is started independently from other processes
+ Processes are iunterruptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoid GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread.
- More memory
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is more complicated
